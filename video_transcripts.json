        "transcript": "0.4s: Data science and data analytics. Are they the \nsame thing? Well, you may have seen these terms  \n8.08s: used interchangeably, but if I'm mining data from \na large dataset, am I performing data science or  \n15.24s: am I performing data analytics? Or what if I'm \ntrying to create a prediction of when my store  \n20.84s: will sell out of our current inventory of \ncantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is  \n27.68s: that science? It's worthwhile to understand the \ndifference to better comprehend what these two  \n33.76s: fields can do, and also, if you're considering \na career in either field. After all, these are two  \n40.2s: different jobs. Somebody who works in the field \nof data science is known as a data scientist.  \n49.36s: For data analytics, that role is called a data \nanalyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question  \n59.44s: because we can classify everything-- data \nmining, data forecasting and all the rest of  \n65.12s: it --as simply data science. And that's because \ndata science is the overarching umbrella term  \n72.32s: that covers tasks related to finding patterns in \nlarge datasets, training machine learning models,  \n77.56s: and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it \ncould be argued, is one task that resides under  \n86.88s: the data science umbrella. It's a specialization \nof data science, and it focuses on querying,  \n94.04s: interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data \nscience is iterative, meaning data scientists form  \n101.76s: hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired \noutcome can be achieved using available data.  \n107.52s: And that is a process that is known as the data \nscience lifecycle, which usually follows seven  \n116.96s: phases. So first is to identify a problem or an \nopportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,  \n126.36s: which is to extract data relevant to that problem \nor opportunity from large datasets. Now that data  \n132.64s: will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies \nand errors, which is fixed in the next stage,  \n138.88s: data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on \nto data exploration analysis to try to make sense  \n146.92s: of that data. We'll then apply feature engineering \nusing domain knowledge to extract details from the  \n154.36s: data. And predictive modeling comes next to use \nthe data to predict or forecast future outcomes  \n162.24s: and behaviors. And then finally, we have data \nvisualization that represents the data points with  \n169.04s: graphical tools such as charts and animations. \nAnd so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a  \n174.4s: data scientist is an in-demand profession right \nnow. If that's something you're interested in,  \n179.76s: you'll want to develop deep skills in machine \nlearning and AI. It's helpful to be able to  \n184.92s: write code in languages such as Python--also in R-- \nit's another popular language for data science. And  \n194.08s: you should have experience working with big data \nplatforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And  \n202.6s: it's also very helpful to have database knowledge \nand SQL. So that's data science. But what about  \n210.44s: its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job \nof a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set  \n219.16s: as it currently exists. So we have some data \nhere and we need to do something with it. And  \n228.32s: we need to be able to make decisions based on \nthis data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,  \n233.84s: four ways. One is through predictive analytics, \nwhich helps to identify trends, correlations and  \n240.6s: causation within datasets like forecasting when \nthose cantaloupes would have all flown off the  \n246.88s: shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions \nwhich will experience a rise in flu cases. There's  \n253.68s: prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely \noutcomes and makes decision recommendations like  \n259.76s: predicting when a tire will wear out and need \nto be replaced. There's diagnostic analytics  \n266.2s: that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred. \nManufacturers can analyze a failed component on an  \n271.88s: assembly line and figure out the reason behind its \nfailure. And then there is descriptive analytics  \n278.64s: which evaluates the qualities and quantities of \na data set. A content streaming provider might  \n284.12s: use descriptive analytics to understand how many \nsubscribers it's lost or how many it's gained over  \n289.36s: a given period of time and what content is being \nwatched. And while a data scientist is a clearly  \n296.8s: defined and specialized role, virtually any \nstakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,  \n303.84s: business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct \nbusiness analytics and visualize KPIs. But many  \n310.28s: organizations do employ professional, dedicated \ndata analysts, responsible for data wrangling  \n316.96s: and interpreting findings like why a company's \nmarketing campaign didn't meet expectations. If  \n322.44s: you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have \nboth analytical and programming skills. So this  \n329.56s: includes familiarity with databases. Also, you'll \nneed to know about statistical analysis. And also  \n338.92s: data visualization is another important skill. \nSo data analytics is often more focused on using  \n347.48s: statistical tools and techniques to interpret \nexisting data and offer actionable insights.  \n353.56s: It's usually less concerned with creating \nnew algorithms or models. Data science,  \n358.2s: on the other hand, has a broader scope that can \ninvolve complex machine learning algorithms, often  \n363.48s: created from scratch. Data science focuses \non phases from data collection to predictive  \n369.4s: modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is \nmore about answering specific questions with  \n375.72s: that data. And if you've done both your \ndata science and data analytics right,  \n382.48s: you'll always be able to keep cantaloupes \nand just about everything else in stock.",
